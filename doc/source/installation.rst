Installation
################


Of course, you will need to install `Python <http://www.python.org/download/>`_
(linux and mac users should have it installed already). We recommend also to install `ipython <http://ipython.org/>`_, which provides a more flexible shell alternative to the python shell itself.

One specificity of **easydev** is to be a pure Python package. However we depend on a few simple
packages namely, colorama (for terminal colors under windows), pexpect and
profiler (optional). They are pure Python packages though and therefore the
following command should install easydev out of the box using the `PyPi <http://pypi.python.org/>`_
command::

    pip install easydev --upgrade
